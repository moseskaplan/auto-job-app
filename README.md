# auto-job-app
Applying to jobs across multiple platforms (LinkedIn, Indeed, Workday) is repetitive and time‑consuming. Existing tools automate some parts of the workflow but do not offer a unified, configurable “control hub” with a load zone for job links, adjustable match‑score thresholds, and flexible approval points. This project is for an MVP of that system.
